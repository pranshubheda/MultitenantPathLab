# Multitenant Pathology Lab Application

We had built this application as a part of our college project.

The main purpose of this project was to convert an application with traditional 3-tier architecture to a SaaS Model, where the same code base could be used to serve multiple clients.

This is an implementation of the paper that we published in the International Conference on Cloud Computing and Virtualization (ICCCV).
